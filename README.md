Base System Using Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) 

This project focuses on building a document base system that uses semantic indexing techniques like Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to improve document search and retrieval. The system allows users to upload documents, store them in a relational database, and perform similarity queries using SQL or Java-based functions. 

The implemented system follows a structured processing flow that begins with loading documents in .txt format. Each document undergoes processing through a function that cleans the text, removes stopwords, and performs lemmatization using the Snowball Stemmer library, effectively reducing words to their root forms (lemmas). This process generates a frequency vector that is stored in the database as a document-term matrix, using the TEXT, TERM, and HAS tables. When the user inputs a query, it undergoes the same preprocessing process and is compared with stored documents using Euclidean distance, resulting in the most relevant documents sorted by semantic proximity. Documents that have no words in common with the query (relevance equals zero) are excluded from the results, ensuring efficient and precise searches
