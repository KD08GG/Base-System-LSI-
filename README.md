Base System Using Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) 

This project focuses on building a document base system that uses semantic indexing techniques like Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to improve document search and retrieval. The system allows users to upload documents, store them in a relational database, and perform similarity queries using SQL or Java-based functions. 

Hypothesis 

By applying LSI techniques, we can improve document retrieval accuracy compared to traditional keyword-based systems. 

We believe that using semantic indexing will allow us to find relevant documents even when they donâ€™t share exact keywords. 

Objectives 

Build a system that stores and manages at least 10 documents. 

Use LSI/SVD to represent documents semantically. 

Allow users to submit queries and retrieve relevant documents using similarity/distance metrics. 

Goals 

Implement a relational database schema to store document-term frequency matrices. 

Apply lemmatization to improve semantic understanding. 

Compare results from cosine similarity and Euclidean distance. 

Develop a basic GUI interface for uploading and querying documents.
